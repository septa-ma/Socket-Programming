# Socket-Programming?
**Is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other.**
***the client acts as the requester, where it requests some data. The server acts as the listener and provides the client the requested data as the response.***

- family=socket.AF_INET -> defines the address family that this socket can accept â€“ only IPv4 addresses. 
- type=socket.SOCK_STREAM -> defines that the socket accepts only TCP connections.
